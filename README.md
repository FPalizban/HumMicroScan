# HumMicroScan
HumMicroScan is a comprehensive RNA-Seq pipeline designed to improve the management of patients with persistent cutaneous infections (PCI), particularly those with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and monogenic skin barrier defects. By leveraging genetic diagnosis, this tool enhances the ability to identify underlying causes of chronic skin conditions.
